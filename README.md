# Shutter-Driver

This code is written for the Arduino Mega, which must be connected to an Adafruit motor shield. The bi-directionality of the current control allows for a mechanical optical shutters to be opened or closed, with outputs for up to four shutters. There are four digital pins on the Arduino used as inputs for computer control of each individual shutter with switches connected for manual override if required. Four digital pins used to light LEDs as indication of the status of each shutter. 

A paper on one type of shutter (Samsung Q1 diaphagm shutters easiest found on eBay) used in conjunction with this driver can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5053212
